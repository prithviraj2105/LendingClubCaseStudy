## General Information
- This project is part of course study assignment. The course is Advanced Certification Program in Machine Learning and Deep Learning (ACP in ML & DL) conducted by IIIT Banglore. The project is solving business problem using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques.
- Lending Club(LC) is a company which provides loans. The problem is that many loans are not repaid by customers. Lending loans to ‘risky’ applicants is the largest source of financial loss. If one is able to identify these risky loan applicants, then such loans can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss.

  Aim of this case study is to understand the driving factors(attributes) behind loan default by analyising past data of Loans using EDA. We can utilise this knowledge for portfolio and risk assessment before giving Loan.

- The data given for analysis is the complete loan data for all loans issued by LC through the time period 2007 to 2011 and it contains information about past loan applicants and whether they ‘defaulted’ or not.

## Conclusions
- Low grade loans have highest impact on Default Rate so consider giving low amount loans and/or increasing interest rates.
- Avoid giving loans to people with bankruptcy records.
- Higher interest rate tend to default more so lower the loan Amount in such loans or lower interest for high grade loans.
- Small Business loans are risky so increase interest or lower amount of loan.
- Higher terms tend to default more so introduce more types of terms like 48 months and/or 42 months.
- Lower income people are taking higher loan amount so reconsider the criteria of minimum income level for higher loans.
